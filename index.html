				<h2>An Introduction To The Runes</h2>
				<p>Runes are an ancient Germanic alphabet, used for writing, divination and magick. They were used throughout northern Europe, Scandinavia, the British Isles, and Iceland from about 100 B.C.E. to 1600 C.E. Runic inscriptions of great age have even been found in North America, supporting stories that the Vikings arrived in the Americas long before Columbus.</p>
				<p>In chapter X of his "Germania, Tacitus (a senator and historian in Ancient Rome) describes a form of divination used by Germanic tribes:"</p>
				<blockquote>"To divination and casting of lots, they pay attention beyond any other people. Their method of casting lots is a simple one: they cut a branch from a fruit-bearing tree and divide it into small pieces which they mark with certain distinctive signs and scatter at random onto a white cloth. Then, the priest of the community if the lots are consulted publicly, or the father of the family if it is done privately, after invoking the gods and with eyes raised to heaven, picks up three pieces, one at a time, and interprets them according to the signs previously marked upon them."</blockquote>
				<p>Runes are an oracle from which one seeks advice. They work best if you detail your current circumstances and then ask a specific question. Rune readings are sometimes obscure. They hint toward answers, but you have to figure out the details. This is when the rune casters intuition becomes paramount.</p>
				<p>Runic divination or "rune casting" is not "fortunetelling" in the sense that one actually sees the future. Instead, runes give one a means of analyzing the path that one is on and a likely outcome. The future is not fixed. It changes with everything one does. If one does not like the prediction, one can always change paths.</p>
				<p>Since ancient times, runes have been used for divination and magic, in addition to writing. The word "rune" actually means mystery, secret or whisper. Each rune has esoteric meanings and properties associated with it, beyond its mundane meaning and phonetic value. Each translates into a word or a phrase signifying concepts important to the early peoples who used them, representing the forces of nature and mind. Each rune has a story attached to it, a relationship to a Norse God.</p>
				<p>Odin, the Norse High God of the Aesir, hung from the world tree, Yggdrasil, impaled on his own spear, for nine days and nights in order to gain the knowledge of runes. When the runes appeared below him, he reached down and took them up, and the runic knowledge gave him power . He later passed on this knowledge to the Vanir goddess Freya. She, in turn, taught him the magic of seidr. Heimdall, the god who guarded the Rainbow Bridge, taught the runes to mankind.</p>

				<h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Choose a subject you wish to query the runes about. It can be as specific or general as you like. Obviously it should be something of concern to you.<span class="important">ONLY CAST THE RUNES ONCE FOR EACH SUBJECT YOU HAVE CHOSEN!</span></li>
					<li>Hover your cursor over each rune in order, one at a time from left to right, to determine its name and if it is reversed.</li>
					<li>Take notice of which era the position of the rune indicates: The past, the present, or the future. This is an important consideration when reading what the rune reveals.</li>
					<li>Click on that rune to read and interpret what it means concerning your subject.</li>
					<li>After deliberating on the rune, close that window. You can always go back to that page by clicking on the rune again...as long as you don't do a recast.</li>
					<li>Continue with the other runes in the same manner.</li>
					<li>Consider how the meaning of each rune relates to the others.</li>
