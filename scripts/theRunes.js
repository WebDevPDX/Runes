				'descriptions' : "<h4>EIHWAZ - Yew Tree</h4><p>Yew was perhaps the most important wood to the ancient northernpeoples. It was the mother of the longbow, the weaponthat brought them food and, in times of war, protection.Not only was the yew tree of immense practical value tothese people but it also held mystical significance as asymbol of death and resurrection. It is still found tothis day in many church cemeteries.</p><p>When Yr appears in a runecast it is generally a verypositive sign. It signifies that the querent is withinstriking distance of his or her target and, with a steadyaim, will achieve it before too long. Sometimes Yr maydenote delay, but nonetheless the outcome is still morethan likely to be positive. On a mystical level, Yrrepresents the ability to put one's inner self intostronger and safer territory. The yew tree is evergreenand highly flexible, yet very strong, and is excellentfor making staffs which may, in turn, be seen as symbolsof inner strength. The yew tree in a churchyard existssymbolically to direct the souls onward to the otherside, revealing that Yr has more than one side to itsnature.</p>",

				'name': 'ANSUR',
				'descriptions' : "<h4>ANSUR - Mouth</h4><p>The Germanic tribes had a strong oral tradition: all their acquired knowledge was passed down from generation to generation by the spoken word alone. As a result, the image of the mouth is very powerful. Even the Bible places great emphasis on the mouth: &quot;In the beginning was the Word and the word was God&quot;.</p><p>This rune can show that the querent is about to undergoan enlightening experience. It can be regarded asinspirational. It implies a state of reception ratherthan of actual speech and often appears in a runecastwhen the querent is about to undergo some form of test orinterview; Ansur upright implies that the querent will dovery well. The rune is also associated withapprenticeship, symbolizing that any learning processwill prove highly productive. It can denote a chancemeeting with someone who is able to shed new light on thesituation.</p><p>The essence of the rune is advice and deliberation. Itshows when hasty action by the querent will cause furtherdifficulties. The best course of action is either to takethe advice of elders or to spend time deliberating beforetaking action. Ansur is regarded as being closely alliedto the planet Mercury, so when the rune shows in areading there is a chance that it signifies a journey ofsome kind.</p><h3>Reversed</h3><p>If upright Ansur represents good advice then, reversed,it indicates bad advice. Whatever the situation, thequerent should not listen too closely to what he or sheis being told because the information is not in theirbest interest. The querent must be careful not to becomeso involved in the situation that they become unable tomake clear decisions. Reversed, the implication is thatthe querent has become &quot;unable to see the wood forthe trees&quot; and must therefore be objective andcautious.</p>",

				'name': 'BJARKAN',
				'descriptions' : "<h4>BJARKAN - Birch</h4><p>This rune is a fertility symbol, drawn to resemble a woman's breasts. In ancient times the birch was regarded as thetree of fertility, and being lightly whipped with birchtwigs was supposed to increase vigor and fertility. Thisbelief is still held in Scandinavia where, after a sauna,people are encouraged to roll in the snow and then endurea quick lashing with a bundle of birch twigs. The phallicmaypole that was traditionally danced around as a symbolof new life, the coming of spring, and fertility ingeneral was more often than not made of birch. So whenBeorc appears in a reading it points clearly toinception, whether of a child, a project, or simply anidea.</p><p>Beorc is generally auspicious. However, because itsymbolizes the mother and, by implication, the child,there is an element of &quot;nourishment&quot; associated with it. Thus, even ifthe rune is essentially beneficial the new project willneed the same kind of succour as an infant. Success willnot come of its own accord; effort and attention will berequired. This may explain the traditional dualityascribed to the birch, the &quot;fruitless tree&quot;,implying that all in not quite as it seems and thatsuccess will be achieved only through genuine application.</p>",

				'name': 'DAEG',
				'descriptions' : "<h4>DAEG - Day</h4><p>Like the sun rising, this is a rune of new beginnings, thedawn of new ideas. Daeg is a very optimistic rune andshows that good times are definitely on their way.Whenever it appears in a runecast it shows that thequerent is moving into a period of growth in any area oflife - perhaps business, family, or inwardly. The querenthas probably been preparing for good times for aconsiderable while, and should not be surprised by thepositive upturn in their life.</p><p>It is important to understand the symbology of the runein terms of the Teutonic tribes. Living close to nature,and particularly living so far north, the beginnings ofspring - with the sun climbing higher in the sky, thedays lengthening, and warmth finally arriving after thelong, cold, dark months of winter - would have been amagical annual reaffirmation of life. After the harshwinter barely surviving in their caves, at last theycould move into the open, get some fresh air andsunlight, and look forward to being able to eat freshfood, especially fruits and vegetables. They would havehad very little fresh food all winter and their healthwould be beginning to suffer.</p><p>Daeg is often more about a state of mind than materialmatters, and its appearance in a runecast often points tothe querent deciding to bring change in his or her life,even if this is only a decision to be more accepting ofwhat exists now. This process of inner acceptanceinvariably has a positive &quot;outer&quot; result. Thephilosophy of acceptance runs counter to modern attitudeswhich tend toward the combative. Yet, when faced withserious obstacles, success can often be achieved by&quot;letting go&quot; rather than putting up a fight.</p>",

				'name': 'EOH',
				'descriptions' : "<h4>EOH - Horse</h4><p>The meaning of Eoh is largely neutral, indicating travel and possible change. On the material level, it denotes change that is generally successful. Such change is unlikely to come as a great surprise as it is probable that he or she has already taken steps and is enquiring about its outcome. In these cases the signs are good. Eoh is associated with the planet Mercury so it has much to do with travel, and the word Eoh itself has been translated as &quot;horse&quot;. Eoh may denote such simple travel as a visit to a relative, but it may also signify a change of home or neighborhood.</p><p>On a more mystical level, Eoh signifies a need toestablish strong connections between oneself and one'semotions. Horses are temperamental animals and need theright mix of encouragement and control if they are to beof value on a journey. The horse was sacred to theancients, and both the sun and moon were pulled in theirchariots across the sky by hroses. As Michael Howardpoints out, one need look no further than the white horseof Uffington, England, carved into the chalky hillside tosee how the ancient people of the North venerated theanimal. The horse is a traditional symbol of power thatcan lead to liberation if understoond and handledcorrectly.</p><h4>Reversed</h4><p>When it appears reversed, the meaning of Eoh remainssubstantially the same as it does when upright. Itsignals travel and change, as before. However, in thisinstance the change may will not be for the better, maypossible not be made out of choice but necessity, and mayperhaps even be totally unexpected. Alternatively, if thequerent is planning to go on a long trip or begin somenew venture it would be wise to put such plans to oneside for now as they are unlikely to prove fortuitous.</p>",

				'name': 'YR',
				'descriptions' : "<h4>YR - Pines or Grass Reeds</h4><p>This rune is like a protective charm, and whenever it turns up in a reading the message is optimistic. The origins of its name is unclear and disputed. Some say that Eolh means &quot;an elk&quot;, others argue that it refers to a particular kind of grass called elk-sedge, and yet others regard it as a reference to amber. Nor is the symbol itself free from dispute, with one camp regarding it as an outstretched hand, another seeing it as an antler, and yet another arguing that it is some kind of staff. However, it is agreed by all that this is a most auspicious and beneficial rune, no matter what place it holds in the cast.</p><p>Eolh signifies that the querent is shielded from dangeror difficulty during the time span to which the questionapplies. It may also signify that a new influence - abeneficial one - is about to enter the querent's life.This could take the form of a new career, or perhaps justa new interest, and may even reveal a forthcomingmarriage. It is also likely that this new influence,whatever it might be, will not arrive as the result ofconscious reasoning and determination. This is a rune offriendship and protection but it is through one's innerself that this friendly influence is manifested. It iswhat the querent needs but also what the querent deserves.</p><h4>Reversed</h4><p>When this rune is reversed in a reading it signifies thatthe querent is being, or about to be duped. People aroundthe querent, whether in business or personalrealtionships, have their own agenda that is not ofbenefit to the querent. Eolh reversed indicates that thequerent needs to take great care and caution becauseothers do not have his best interests at heart; indeed,others may do their level best to ensure that the querentunjustly takes the blame for a mistake.</p>",

				'name': 'FE',
				'descriptions' : "<h4>FE - Cattle, Wealth, Money</h4><p>Thisis the first letter of the Germanic alphabet, and isconcerned with worldly wealth and possessions. In ancienttime the main measure of wealth and status was the numberof livestock a person owned. Livestock was much moreimportant than land as the ancient Germanic peoples wereessentially nomadic.</p><p>This rune implies that wealth and success can be obtainedthrough hard work rather than inherited wealth: cattleare not easy to look after and require considerable timeand attention. This image is reinforced by the fact that,as the Germanic tribes gave up their nomadic existenceand settled the land, cattle played an increasinglyimportant role as workhorses in the cultivation of theland. There is also an image of conservation in this rune:the cow is a female symbol representing nourishment andcontinuity, and in ancient time would have been essentialfor survival in the long dark months of winter.</p><p>The ideas behind this rune are of gain being achievedagainst the odds. and also of advantage or vanquishingopposition. The counsel the rune offers, then, is thatsuccess may be achieved in the face of opposition, aslong as a cautious approach is assumed.</p><h4>Reversed</h4><p>If the upright Feoh implies expansion, vanquishing andgain, then reversed it signifies loss, restriction andbeing overcome by the odds. This always has a negativetone but the negative effects are mediated by thesurrounding runes. If the accompanying runes are positivethe reversed Feoh means only delays; but if they arenegative, this indicates that matters are beyond repairand there is no hope of a satisfactory outcome. Thisapplies not only in financial matters but also in affairsof the heart, perhaps signifying the end of arelationship.</p>",

				'name': 'GYFU',
				'descriptions' : "<h4>GYFU - Gift</h4><p>When we want to indicate that two people are extremely close we cross our first and second fingers and say &quot;they're like that &quot;. The symbol of a cross to signify union has been used since ancient times, and, with each stroke resting on the other, implies complete harmony. Geofu is associated with Venus, the goddess of love, so whenever this rune appears in a reading you can be sure that the querent is concerned with matters of the heart. In general, Geofu is a benevolent influence, although the surrounding runes explain more and may even indicate difficulties in relationships. The appearance of Geofu in a runecast often signifies that the querent is, or soon will be, in a generally peaceful and relaxed state of mind, at peace with themselves and the rest of the world.</p><p>On an inner level, this rune may be issuing a form ofwarning. Geofu shows that some gift - whether of money,love, or wisdom - is likely to come the querent's way. Asthe saying goes, &quot;nothing in life comes for free&quot;.All gifts imply that one has to give back - whether inthis world or the next - at least as much as one hasreceived. There is always a price to pay. In a sense,this rune reveals the immutable law of karma - &quot;asyou sow so shall ye reap&quot;. Therefore it is not wiseto consider this rune as entirely positive. It may wellprove to be very productive, but there are alwaysattendant responsibilities that are to be ignored only atyour peril.</p>",
