<h2>ANSUR (<i>AHN soor</i>)- Mouth</h2>
        <p>The Germanic tribes had a strong oral tradition: all their acquired knowledge was passed down from generation to generation by the spoken word alone. As a result, the image of the mouth is very powerful. Even the Bible
        places great emphasis on the mouth: &quot;In the
        beginning was the Word and the word was God&quot;.

        This rune can show that the querent is about to undergo
        an enlightening experience. It can be regarded as
        inspirational. It implies a state of reception rather
        than of actual speech and often appears in a runecast
        when the querent is about to undergo some form of test or
        interview; Ansur upright implies that the querent will do
        very well. The rune is also associated with
        apprenticeship, symbolizing that any learning process
        will prove highly productive. It can denote a chance
        meeting with someone who is able to shed new light on the
        situation.

        The essence of the rune is advice and deliberation. It
        shows when hasty action by the querent will cause further
        difficulties. The best course of action is either to take
        the advice of elders or to spend time deliberating before
        taking action. Ansur is regarded as being closely allied
        to the planet Mercury, so when the rune shows in a
        reading there is a chance that it signifies a journey of
        some kind.</p>
        <h3>Reversed</h3>
        <p>If upright Ansur represents good advice then, reversed,
        it indicates bad advice. Whatever the situation, the
        querent should not listen too closely to what he or she
        is being told because the information is not in their
        best interest. The querent must be careful not to become
        so involved in the situation that they become unable to
        make clear decisions. Reversed, the implication is that
        the querent has become &quot;unable to see the wood for
        the trees&quot; and must therefore be objective and
        cautious.</p>
