        <h4>BEORC (<em>BIH ohrk</em>) - Birch</h4>
        <p>This rune is a fertility symbol, drawn to resemble a woman's
        breasts. In ancient times the birch was regarded as the
        tree of fertility, and being lightly whipped with birch
        twigs was supposed to increase vigor and fertility. This
        belief is still held in Scandinavia where, after a sauna,
        people are encouraged to roll in the snow and then endure
        a quick lashing with a bundle of birch twigs. The phallic
        maypole that was traditionally danced around as a symbol
        of new life, the coming of spring, and fertility in
        general was more often than not made of birch. So when
        Beorc appears in a reading it points clearly to
        inception, whether of a child, a project, or simply an
        idea.</p>

        <p>Beorc is generally auspicious. However, because it
        symbolizes the mother and, by implication, the child,
        there is an element of &quot;nourishment&quot; associated with it. Thus, even if
        the rune is essentially beneficial the new project will
        need the same kind of succour as an infant. Success will
        not come of its own accord; effort and attention will be
        required. This may explain the traditional duality
        ascribed to the birch, the &quot;fruitless tree&quot;,
        implying that all in not quite as it seems and that
        success will be achieved only through genuine application.</p>
        
        <h4>Reversed</h4>

        <p>Reversed, Beorc becomes a symbol of sterility, implying
        difficulties and misunderstandings on the domestic front.
        Perhaps a desired pregnancy will prove impossible, or a
        current pregnancy be terminated. Alternatively, it can
        point to worries over children, especially in terms of
        health. However, the surrounding runes always give a much
        clearer picture. A reversed Beorc is not particularly
        malign of itself and requires other more ruthless runes
        to imply real trouble, while helpful runes definitely
        alleviate the situation.</p>
