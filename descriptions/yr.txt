        <p>Yew was perhaps the most important wood to the ancient northern
        peoples. It was the mother of the longbow, the weapon
        that brought them food and, in times of war, protection.
        Not only was the yew tree of immense practical value to
        these people but it also held mystical significance as a
        symbol of death and resurrection. It is still found to
        this day in many church cemeteries.</p>
        
        <p>When Yr appears in a runecast it is generally a very
        positive sign. It signifies that the querent is within
        striking distance of his or her target and, with a steady
        aim, will achieve it before too long. Sometimes Yr may
        denote delay, but nonetheless the outcome is still more
        than likely to be positive. On a mystical level, Yr
        represents the ability to put one's inner self into
        stronger and safer territory. The yew tree is evergreen
        and highly flexible, yet very strong, and is excellent
        for making staffs which may, in turn, be seen as symbols
        of inner strength. The yew tree in a churchyard exists
        symbolically to direct the souls onward to the other
        side, revealing that Yr has more than one side to its
        nature.</p>
        
        <p> As with Jara and Is, Yr shows no distinction whichever
        way it falls in a runecast. Because of this, particular
        attention must be paid to the surrounding runes in the
        cast, as they reveal the kind of anticipatory actions the
        querent should take to avoid problems. Yr shows that
        there is a way out of any dificulty as long as the
        situation is approached in the correct manner.
