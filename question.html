				<h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Choose a subject you wish to query the runes about. It can be as specific or general as you like. Obviously it should be something of concern to you.<span class="important">ONLY CAST THE RUNES ONCE FOR EACH SUBJECT YOU HAVE CHOSEN!</span></li>
					<li>Hover your cursor over each rune in order, one at a time from left to right, to determine its name and if it is reversed.</li>
					<li>Take notice of which era the position of the rune indicates: The past, the present, or the future. This is an important consideration when reading what the rune reveals.</li>
					<li>Click on that rune to read and interpret what it means concerning your subject.</li>
					<li>After deliberating on the rune, close that window. You can always go back to that page by clicking on the rune again...as long as you don't do a recast.</li>
					<li>Continue with the other runes in the same manner.</li>
					<li>Consider how the meaning of each rune relates to the others.</li>
