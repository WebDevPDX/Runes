# Runes

This is a project I took on as a portfolio piece. I came across an old website and decided to modernize it. 
The old version can be found here: http://home.grandecom.net/~jaws007/Runes/Runes.htm

The project is about the JS functionality and not about the content of the website. While there is some content added, I did not 
fully finish that side of the project. If I have more time on my hands, I might do that but for now I prefer to have the functionality 
done as portfolio piece and move on to a new project for said portfolio.
